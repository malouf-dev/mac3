# mac3

**GTA III, native on Apple Silicon.** A build that renders through
**Metal**, runs sharp at full **Retina** resolution, and turns on macOS **Game
Mode** automatically. One command turns your own copy of the original game —
Steam, retail disc, or files from an old PC — into a ready-to-play `mac3.app`.
No administrator password needed.

This repository hosts the **download only** — there is no source code here.

> ⚠️ **This needs the original GTA III, not the Definitive Edition.** The
> Definitive Edition is a different, rebuilt game and will not work.

## Install

**You need:** an Apple Silicon Mac (M1 or newer) on macOS 15.7.9 or later, and
your own copy of the **original GTA III** — the classic 2001/2002 PC
release, *not* the Definitive Edition
([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/12100/) works out of the box — you
never have to launch it).

1. Open **Terminal** (`Cmd+Space`, type `Terminal`, press Enter), paste this
   line and press Enter:

   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtamac/mac3/main/quick-install.sh | bash
   ```

   It finds your game files automatically (a Steam copy, or an already-installed
   mac3.app) and puts **mac3.app** in your Downloads folder — about a minute,
   the app is ~1.2 GB with the game inside.

2. When Finder opens, **drag mac3 into Applications** — or just double-click it
   to play right away.

**Using a non-Steam copy?** Add the path to the end of the command — a game
folder (the one with `models`, `data`, `audio`, …) or a GTA III `.app` that
contains the files (including Wineskin/Wine wrappers) both work — again, from
the original game, not the Definitive Edition:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtamac/mac3/main/quick-install.sh | bash -s -- ~/Downloads/"Grand Theft Auto 3.app"
```

**Upgrading?** Run the same one-liner again — it reuses the game files from your
installed app.

Prefer a classic disk image? Add `--dmg` to get a drag-to-Applications
`mac3.dmg` instead: `... | bash -s -- --dmg`.

## Direct downloads

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`mac3-macos-arm64.tar.gz`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtamac/mac3/main/mac3-macos-arm64.tar.gz) | the app with no game assets, for building your own bundle |
| [`mac3-macos-arm64.zip`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtamac/mac3/main/mac3-macos-arm64.zip) | the same, zipped |
| [`quick-install.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtamac/mac3/main/quick-install.sh) | the installer the one-liner runs |
| [`signtool-arm64.tar.gz`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtamac/mac3/main/signtool-arm64.tar.gz) | the bundled ad-hoc signer, so installing needs no Xcode |

## Legal

mac3 requires the files from your own legally purchased copy of the original
Grand Theft Auto III. No game assets are distributed here.

## What's new

**Latest update**

- Liberty City is busy by default — pedestrian and traffic density now start
  at maximum, so the streets are full from the first drive. Both are still
  sliders under Display settings if you would rather have it quieter.

## The port

GTA III running natively on Apple Silicon, with the same treatment
[macVC](https://github.com/gtamac/macVC) gives Vice City.

**Rendering**

- Renders through Metal (via ANGLE) instead of Apple's deprecated OpenGL
- HDR: true extended-range highlights on XDR and HDR displays, on by default
  (Graphics → HDR)
- MetalFX upscaling with five presets — Quality and Balanced use the spatial
  scaler, Performance, Max and Ultra use the temporal one. Balanced by
  default; set it to Off for native resolution. Applied from the main menu,
  before you load a save.
- 4x MSAA by default, plus mipmapped, trilinear and anisotropically filtered
  textures
- Extended draw distance with the original fog, and vehicles that fade in with
  distance instead of popping into view
- All three islands stay loaded, so there is no pause crossing the bridges

**macOS**

- Opens in native fullscreen on the display you launched it from, at your
  screen's real Retina resolution
- Game Mode turns on automatically while it runs
- Settings and saves live in `~/Library/Application Support/mac3/`, safely
  outside the app
- Fixes the classic "mouse sometimes not detected" bug, and keeps the cursor
  inside the game in fullscreen menus
- Tells you when a new version is out, and can install it for you

**Installing**

- One command builds a ready-to-play `mac3.app` from your own copy of the game
- Finds the Steam copy on its own, including the radio stations and mission
  dialogue that the Steam release stores away from the game files
- Needs no administrator password and no Xcode
